# criticality
Repo contains code for algorithms which calculate the spatiotemporal cascade of activity and measures critical statistics.


'IS' - importance sampling for power law hypothesis testing, loglikelihood ratio calculation of power law vs lognormal distribution

'admin_functions' - functions for data file naming and structuring

'av_dev' - calculates critical statistics over development from 3 - 8 days post fertilisation

'avalanches' - contains main functions for calculating critical statistics - nearest neigbours, avalance algorithm, branching ratio, correlation function

'avfig...' - figures for criticality paper
